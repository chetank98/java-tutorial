This is a program to check if the number is prime or not.

The logic is that

Take a number as a input from the user

we take isPrime as boolean default true

if will be false when number is divided by every number of a loop , if remainder is 0 then isPrime become false and break the loop.

if isPrime is true then it is a prime number and if false then not.
