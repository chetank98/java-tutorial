Create a college course registration application.

There must be multiple departments.

Each department must have at least 3 classes taught.

Each class must be taught by at least one professor.

A student may register for multiple classes, but no class may overlap in timeframe with another class.

No professor may teach more than one class at the same time.

To create that application you must create a Department class, a Professor class, a Class class, a Student class... and
there will be multiple Class, Professor and Student. Try to make 3 different departments, 2 professors per department, 3 classes per department, and
at least 10 students total. That should definitely get you some good experience building a fairly straightforward OOP focused application.
