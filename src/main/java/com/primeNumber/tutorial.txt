The program checks if a number is prime or not.

First, it takes a number from the user as input.

We assume the number is prime by setting a boolean variable isPrime = true.

Then we use a loop to check if the number is divisible by any number from 2 up to the square root of the number.

If the number is divisible (i.e. remainder is 0), then it cannot be a prime, so we set isPrime = false and stop checking further.

We use Math.sqrt(n) to make the loop faster, because you only need to check up to the square root for factors.

Finally, if isPrime is still true, we print "Prime Number", otherwise we print "Not a Prime Number".
